# Ohio Election Shapefile
The shapefile is a lightly edited VTD. Edits are based on more recent shapefiles from counties. A few precincts were merged to match election results.
This shapefile was compiled and processed by the Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group (MGGG). 

## Sources
Raw data for Ohio's precinct boundaries was sourced from election and other county officials and processed by members of MGGG and students at VRDI. For more information on the sourcing of this data, please refer to the Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group's [Ohio Precincts Github repository](https://github.com/mggg/ohio-precincts). Election data come the [Ohio Secretary of State](https://www.sos.state.oh.us/elections/election-results-and-data/2016-official-elections-results/) and the [MIT Election Data Science Lab](https://electionlab.mit.edu). Demographic data were downloaded at the census block level from [IPUMS NHGIS](https://www.nhgis.org).

## Preprocessing
Demographic data were aggregated from the block level using MGGGâ€™s proration software [maup](https://github.com/mggg/maup). Congressional, house, and senate district IDs were assigned to precincts also using this package.

## Notes
Election abbreviations are all according to our codes except supreme court justices. Those are SCJ. There's SCJ20D1/R1, SCJ20D2/R2, and SCJ20D/R. The ones without numbers are summed by party. 1 is the O'Donnell/Kennedy race, 2 is Brunner/French. You can read more about this on [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/Ohio_Supreme_Court), but Ohio Supreme Court elections are technicallly nonpartisan and they come out of a partisan primary so it's basically a partisan in practice even if it's not official.

For population breakdowns, anything ending in '19' (example NH_WHITE19) is taken from American Community Survey 5-year estimates (2014-2019). Anything ending in '10' (example NH_WHITE10) is taken from the decennial census data.
